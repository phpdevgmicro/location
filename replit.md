# Overview

This is a PHP-based medical location finder website for a healthcare organization ("Specialty Care Clinics") with multiple locations across Texas. The site features an interactive Google Maps-powered location search tool that allows users to find nearby medical facilities by address, filter by location type, and adjust search radius. The project displays information for 30+ medical facilities including Primary Care Offices, Orthopedic centers, Pain Management clinics, and other specialty services.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack**: PHP website with JavaScript/Google Maps integration
- PHP server-side rendering (`index.php` as main entry point)
- Three CSS files: 
  - `site.css` - Global site styles (minified)
  - `custom.css` - Component-specific styling
  - `locations.css` - Location finder specific styles (flexbox layout fixes)
- Responsive design patterns using CSS grid and flexbox
- Google Maps JavaScript API for interactive location mapping
- Google Places API for address autocomplete
- Fixed positioning navigation header

**Design Decisions**:
- **Problem**: Need for interactive location finder with real-time search and mapping
- **Solution**: PHP-based site with Google Maps integration and JavaScript for dynamic interactions
- **Rationale**: Enables address search, distance filtering, and visual map display while maintaining server-side simplicity
- **Trade-offs**: Requires JavaScript enabled, API key management, but gains rich interactive features

## Map Controls & User Experience

**Map Zoom Control**:
- Map uses `gestureHandling: 'greedy'` mode, allowing users to zoom with mouse scroll wheel without holding Ctrl key
- Smooth and intuitive map navigation experience

**Smooth Scrolling**:
- Card listing has `scroll-behavior: smooth` for better user experience when scrolling through locations
- Independent scrolling for card listing panel while map remains fixed

## Location Finder Features

**Interactive Search & Filtering**:
- Address autocomplete using Google Places API
- Real-time location header update displaying selected address (e.g., "Showing Locations Near: Dallas, TX")
- Location type filtering (Primary Care, Orthopedic, Pain Management, General Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Podiatry, Vascular Surgery, Cardiology, Oncology, Chiropractic)
- Distance-based search radius (5mi, 10mi, 20mi, 50mi options)
- Dynamic results display with distance calculations using Haversine formula

**Map Integration**:
- Interactive Google Maps display centered on Dallas, TX by default
- Custom marker icons for different location types:
  - `5_1760719237353.png` - Urgent Care (red marker)
  - `6_1760719237353.png` - Hospital (blue marker)
  - `7_1760719237354.png` - Specialty Care (purple marker)
  - `8_1760719237355.png` - Primary Care (green marker)
  - `9_1760719237356.png` - Infusions (teal marker)
  - `10_1760719237356.png` - All Other Locations (light blue circle marker)
- User location marker displayed when address is selected
- Map legend showing all location types with icons

**Location Display Cards** (Updated October 2025):
- Clean white card design with subtle shadow (`box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`)
- Location name and type (1.1rem, font-weight: 600, color: #0c3666)
- Distance information from user's location (1rem, font-weight: 500)
- Split address display for better readability:
  - Street address on first line
  - City, State, ZIP on second line
- Phone number in green color (ðŸ“ž 866-794-9781)
- "Show on map" link with map pin emoji icon
- "LOCATION DETAILS" button (full width, #0c3666 background, no border-radius)

## Data Structure

**Location Data Management**:
- JSON-formatted location data stored in `/attached_assets/` directory
- Structured data model with `type`, `count`, `description`, and `addresses` fields
- Multiple duplicate files suggest data versioning or backup strategy
- Three primary facility types: Primary Care (14 locations), Orthopedic (10 locations), Pain Management (6 locations)

**Data Schema**:
```json
{
  "type": "string",           // Facility category
  "count": "number",          // Total locations
  "description": "string",    // Service details
  "addresses": ["string"]     // List of physical addresses
}
```

**Design Decisions**:
- **Problem**: Managing multi-location healthcare facility information
- **Solution**: Centralized JSON data structure with categorized facility types
- **Alternatives Considered**: Database-driven approach vs. static files
- **Rationale**: Static JSON files chosen for simplicity and direct integration with static site
- **Pros**: Easy to edit, version control friendly, no database overhead
- **Cons**: Manual updates required, no dynamic filtering without JavaScript

## Styling Architecture

**CSS Organization**:
- Modular separation between custom components and site-wide styles
- Reset/normalization patterns (removing default margins on common elements)
- Utility-first class naming convention (e.g., `.gd-g--center`, `.btn`, `.pageheader`)

**Layout Patterns**:
- Fixed navigation for accessibility
- Centered text alignment for headers and content
- Custom button styling with border treatments
- Grid-based layout system (indicated by `.gd-g` prefix classes)

# External Dependencies

## CSS Resources
- Character encoding set to UTF-8 for proper text rendering
- No external CSS frameworks detected (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)
- Custom CSS written from scratch

## Data Assets

  - Refined typography and spacing to match reference exactly

## Known Issues
- **Geocoding API Permission Required**: The Google Maps API key needs the Geocoding API enabled to calculate distances and show location coordinates. Without this:
  - Locations may not load properly
  - Distance calculations will not work
  - Map markers may not appear
  - To fix: Enable the Geocoding API in Google Cloud Console for the API key: AIzaSyBj68ryDqKcMZSC0CC03YOcMXLmIVHqrGE
